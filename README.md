## How to develop for Kastle 2

Read [Toolchain Install Guide](TOOLCHAIN_INSTALL.md), [Coding Style Guide](CODING_STYLE.md) and [Glossary & Examples](GLOSSARY_EXAMPLES.md).  
Any questions or weird stuff hapenning? See the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## Specifications

- Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU (264 kB RAM, clocked at 176 MHz)
- 8 MB flash for firmware and data
- 256 B EEPROM for storing calibration and settings
- 44kHz/16-bit stereo audio quality
- USB-C or 3xAA battery power (with automatic switching)
- 18 analog inputs (12-bit)
  - 2 direct inputs (sample rate > 1 kHz)
  - 16 multiplexed inputs (sample rate > 100 Hz)
- 3 digital inputs
- 3 analog outputs (using filtered 10-bit PWM)
- 3 digital outputs
- Stereo audio input (up to 6 Vpp)
- Stereo headphone output (suitable for up to 250 Ohm headphones)
- 3 RGB LEDs
- USB MIDI input & output - see the [MIDI Mappings](MIDI_MAPPINGS.md)

All inputs are designed to accept voltages in the range of 0-5V unless specified.  
All outputs are designed to provide 0-5V (0V to the input voltage, respectively).

## Connectivity
- USB-C (power, firmware updates, MIDI)
- Sync in jack (expects a clock signal at tip)
- Sync out jack (produces a clock signal at tip)
- Audio in jack
- Headphone out jack

## User interface
- 7 potentiometers
- 2 buttons
- Pin headers for patching
- Power switch

## Power consumption, battery life

Power consumption is approximately 100-150 mA, allowing for up to 15-18 hours of use on 3xAA batteries.

## Citadel

[Bastl Instruments Citadel](https://github.com/bastl-instruments/citadel) is a Eurorack adaptation of the Kastle 2 family. It's directly compatible with the Kastle 2 firmwares, there are no extra Citadel builds. The firmware itself detects the variant it's running on (based on the MIDI pull-up resistor on RX line) and adjusts necessary parameters.

## Open Source Firmwares

The full firmware list is here: [app list](APP_LIST.md).

**FX Wizard**   
Nine time-based audio effects, with DJ-style lowpass/highpass filter.

**Wave Bard**   
Stereo sample player featuring unique sequencing techniques.

And other examples, see the `code/src/apps` subfolder.
